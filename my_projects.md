| [Maven Healthcare Challenge](https://github.com/andyguo0228/maven_healthcare/blob/main/maven_health.md)      | This project is my submission for the [Maven Healthcare Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-healthcare-challenge/26). My goal is to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data and determine if it was able to improve quality of care and service to patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Python, Tableau      |
| [Divvy Bike Share Project](https://github.com/andyguo0228/bike_share_python/blob/main/bike_share_project.md) | An in-depth analysis of Chicago's Divvy Bike Share program, originally completed as part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate. Employing tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the analysis focuses on the program's pricing plans and categorization of users into casual riders and annual members. The study includes comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where data types are thoroughly examined and transformed, emphasizing the behavioral patterns of different user groups. Key aspects of the project involve sophisticated data manipulation, visualization, and the derivation of insights critical for improving the program's business strategies. This work showcases my proficiency in data analytics and my ability to convert complex datasets into meaningful and actionable business intelligence | Python, Seaborn      |
| [Bellabeat Project](https://github.com/andyguo0228/bellabeat_project/blob/main/bellabeat.md)                 | This is my data analysis project for Bellabeat, a women's health tech company. The project utilizes Python, SQL, and Tableau to analyze user smart device data, aiming to uncover insights for optimizing Bellabeat's marketing strategy. It encompasses data preparation in PostgreSQL, thorough data cleaning, and detailed analysis, with the goal of providing actionable recommendations to enhance Bellabeat's engagement with its target audience and improve its digital marketing efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Python, SQL, Tableau |
